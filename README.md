# Reed Job Search
## What this application does
This Excel worksheet is just a easier way to search jobs posted on reed.co.uk and to view the information in table format inside Excel or export the data to CSV.

## Why you should try it
### Advantages
- **Information in table format:** you can filter out the jobs you are not interested quickly;
- **Export the data:** you can export the data to CSV and use it to provide insights and data analysis for whatever and wherever you want;
- **More details about the job:** the API shows more details about the job position, like *expiration date* and *applicants* number;

### Disadvantages
Alright, everything isn't flowers, we have some disadvantages to consider:
- **Limitation:** The Reed Job Search API allows us to make no more than *2000* requests per hour;
- **Save the job advert:** there is no option to save the job in your favourites, although you can save it in your Excel spreadsheet;
- **Application:** you need to open the browser to apply for that position, would be amazing if it was possible to apply via API.

## How to use
### Getting the API Key
On the video below you can see how to get the API Key. The API Key is used to grant access to the API and allow the HTTP requests via our VBA code. It is a basic authentication, so don't worry about access and refresh tokens (OAuth).

### How to use the worksheet
The worksheet is self-learned and intuitive.
Type the keywords on *What job are you looking for*. E.g **Data Scientist**
